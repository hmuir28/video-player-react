## Project In Progress

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

You will be able to sign in, however, we're still in progress the development phase, so <br />
you won't see loaded videos on your main panel. We're planning to develop an app mobile to do so, <br />
Thanks for your patience :)

Please, take a look at the code and give your feedback about it, I will be happy to work on your suggestions.
